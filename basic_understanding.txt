192.67.20.xx series network, has tv connected 

	tv 1
	tv2
	tc 3
	........10
	
192.67.10.xx series netowrk which has 10 mobiles connected as show below
	mob 1
	mob 2....10
	
	
here we have linux server: ip a 
2: eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c8:1f:66:f6:d2:e1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

and we are using what is connected to chromecast
to be discovered under mobile 

mob 1 cast to tv1 not discovered


all mob and all tv can be discovered in same network say wlan 


we want each tv to discover each mob and not to be discovered by other 
1:1 conncection is via different n/w 

Use avahi as a broker and then be a bridge to establish one to one 1:1 

now if we start avahi, it will discover to everyone but we don't want to reflect.

		// mob 			tv
		myfunc(192.67.10.5, 192.67.20.10)
		{	
			// create this part, how can we acheive this via avahi
			the function name ?
		}
		
		
		mdns protocol
		avahi is made to listen to these packets 

check the below functions and read/study avahi
avahi_dns_packet_is_query
avahi_dns_packet_new_response
avahi_dns_packet_get_field
