Scen 1:
	Mobile Network 	- 192.168.10.x (Source)
					  192.168.10.1, 192.168.10.2, 192.168.10.3, 192.168.10.4, 192.168.10.5
	TV Network 		- 192.168.20.x (Destinations)
					  192.168.20.1, 192.168.20.2, 192.168.20.3, 192.168.20.4, 192.168.20.5
	Linux 			- Connected to both network
		Avahi 		- not enabled
			Outcome	- Mobiles cannot discover any of the TV
		Avahi		- Enabled
			Outcome	- All mobiles can discover all TVs
			Reason	- Avahi listens to MDNS packets on all interfaces and it forwards the packets between all interfaces
	Objective		- Establish 1-to-1 connection between mobile and TV
						Eg. 192.168.10.1 should only discover 192.168.20.1 and
	Process			- Install and start Avahi service
					- Disable Avahi
					- Create a C/C++ program
						- This will interface with Avahi
						- Our C/C++ program will know the source IP address (mobile - 192.168.10.3) and target IP address (TV - 192.168.20.10)
						- mDNS query (generated by the mobile - 192.168.10.3) will be given as an input to the C/C++ program
						- The program to identify which Avahi function should be called to pass on the mDNS query as Unicast query to the TV network
						- Get the unicast response from TV network for the above query and pass it to mobile network as an unicast response
						

avahi reflects all packects => we don't need that, this will listen to all the network and avahi only forwards that by default=> not required


			afunc_custom_mdns_query(mob, tv)
			{
				// handle and manipulate and create 1:1 conection 
				// when avahi is disabled 
			}
			
			we can modify the service and avahi c files or create our own service or c program that restricts to send and forward the packets.
			
Avahi => When turned on it forwards packet between networks (mob - 192.168.10.26 and tv  - 192.168.20.114) without restriction.

A service that'll filter the query and response and send only to the specific Mob or TV (This we know the IP Address of both the mob and tv that are permitted for connection).

1 - C program will me listening in Mobile and Tv networks
2 - Mobile will send a MDNS query.
3 - The C program will capture the query of the mobile and forward it to the Tv network.
4 - Tv will respond to the query 
5 - the C program will forward the query to the mobile network (unicast, so only the specific mobile can see).
6 -  The connection will get established (basically the Linux server will act as a proxy server to forward mdns packets between mob and tv network).
			
			
			
			Make sure this mobile is not automatically forwarded and detected by tv network (needs to be prevented ) unless
			we make integration run.
			
1. what we can do is => disable avahi , to prevent forward the avahi packets. 
2. Figure out how to test that packets are not forwarded when avahi disabled, so we need to connect multiple tvs and mobiles to test [reconfirm once]
3. check whether they are detected or not 
4. Run prog and check if i can find TV without enabling avahi
